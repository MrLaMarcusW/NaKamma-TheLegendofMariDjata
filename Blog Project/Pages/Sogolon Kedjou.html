                <h2>Who is Sogolon Kedjou?</h2>

                <p>Sogolon Kedjou is a devotee of traditional African animist beliefs, particularly the reverence of ancestral spirits and the worship of natural elements.</p>

            <div class="sogolon-content-info3">
                <p>In the epic, Sogolon is portrayed as the daughter of the "buffalo woman", Dò Kamissa, so-called because of her "ugliness" and hunchback, and so was Sogolon. The griots of Guinea refer to Sogolon as the younger sister of Do Kamissa. In many parts of the Senegambia region, and Mali, Sogolon is regarded as her daughter. As well as her physical deformities and "ugliness", Sogolon also gave birth to a disabled son (Sundiata), and was ridiculed for that. Following the death of her husband Famaghana Kon Fatta, her co-wife, the politically ambitious Sassouma Bereté, Naré Maghann's first wife along with their first son Dankaran Toumani Keïta, plotted against Sogolon and her children, including assassination attempts on their lives. Fearing that the new King Dankaran and his mother Sassouma could inflict harm upon her and her children, Sogolon went into exile with her children to protect them from harm.</p>
