                <h2>Who is Famaghana Kon Fatta?</h2>
                <p>In West Africa, after the powerful Ghana Empire collapsed, many kingdoms tried to rebuild themselves. Maghan Kon Fatta was the ruler of one of these small states, Mali.</p>
                <p>Famaghan Kon Fatta is described as very handsome and a good king. He often sits with his court and his griot, Gnankouman Doua, under the large silk-cotton tree in Niani and listens to stories.</p>

                <p>The capital of Niani was situated on the agriculturally rich floodplain of upper Niger, with good grazing land further north.</p>

            <div class="famaghana-content-info3">
                <p>In the Epic of Sundiata, Naré Famaghana Konaté (also called Farako Manko Farakonken, Famaghana Kon Fatta or Famaghana the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a divine hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konaté married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king. Naré Maghann Konaté was already married to Sassouma Bereté and had a son by her, Dankaran Touman Keïta. However, when two Traoré hunters from the Do kingdom presented him an ugly, hunchbacked woman named Sogolon Condé, he remembered the prophecy and married her. She soon gave birth to a son, Sundiata, who was unable to walk throughout most of his childhood until 7 years old.
                After Naré Maghann Konaté's death, his first son, Dankaran Toumani Keita, assumed the throne despite Konaté's wishes that the prophecy be respected. Sundiata nonetheless overcame both his handicap and his brother's scorn to eventually defeat the Sosso invader Soumaoro Kanté, thus ensuring the Mandinka's dominance over the region in the form of the Mali Empire.</p>
